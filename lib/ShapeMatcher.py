# Convert to .ppm: https://convertio.co/

# Warning: these methods have not been thoroughly
# and I don't have a lot of experience calling terminal commands from within Python
# so if things start going wrong I suggest using ShapeMatcher directy from the terminal as it's indended
# I hope to add more functions later to make using ShapeMatcher from within Python a bit easier
# because the documentation for ShapeMatcher is not very detailed and outdated

# A sad error message in case sad things happen
